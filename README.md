# Project Overview

A simple employee dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) calculator that shows the growth of an investment in a stock over time.

The user will input the ticker for the stock of their choice, and proceed to input relevant details of their investment plan (shares already owned, initial lump-sum purchase, monthly contribution, years of investment, expected yearly growth rate in stock price, current dividend yield, expected yearly dividend growth rate, and tax rate). Once all inputs are received, the DRIP table will be printed in the console.
